# Sass Boilerplate
My Sass experience

- - - -

### Documentation
[Directory and file structure](/STRUCTURE.md)

### Don‚Äôt follow rules
I tried to give you some guidelines based on my own experience.

I doesn‚Äôt mean everything will work for you, so my best advice is :
1. Try to improve your naming
2. keep it consistent for a given project
3. but avoid over-engineering

__If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable, just skip it.__

__Enjoy!__ üçí
